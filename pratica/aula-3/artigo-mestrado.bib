  abstract = {Here we report the first case study of the significant algae blooming in large reservoirs in relation to the COVID-19 lockdown in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and phycocyanin (PC) concentrations were estimated for the Guarapiranga and Billings reservoirs, which supply daily water use for over 20 million people and receives treated wastewater. We employed field-calibrated Sentinel 2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI images to map the spatial patterns of Chl-a and PC over the two periods: before the lockdown (April, August and October 2019) and after the lockdown in S\~ao Paulo (April 2020). We found a significant increase in algae pigments (Chl-a and PC) in both reservoirs in April 2020, compared to the same month of 2019. We show that the episodic algae blooming is strongly related to the increased inflows of the residential wastewater from the surrounding watersheds, because the household water use has increased \textasciitilde 3.2\% in April 2020, while the runoff into the reservoirs driven by the rainfall was much lower in 2020 compared to the previous year for the same month. In the case of Guarapiranga Reservoir, PC increased nearly 500\% in April 2020 compared to April 2019. Given the importance of Billings and Guarapiranga reservoirs for the water supply of the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo (MRSP), the abrupt occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms related to the state's lockdown should be considered a major concern for public and environmental health of the region. Although several environmental consequences have been reported due to the COVID-19 worldwide, this study is the first to report the impact of COVID-19 on the trophic state in the tropical reservoirs.},

  abstract = {\textbf{Background:} Asejire and Eleyele Lakes are sources of water supply and used for fishing activities in southwestern Nigeria. However, various anthropogenic activities occur in their catchment area that could lead to deterioration of the ecological status. The purpose of this research was to determine the trophic status of the lakes (on which there is limited information) based on the environmental variables, chlorophyll a and phytoplankton assemblage.{$<$}br /{$>$} \textbf{Methods:} Water samples were collected for six months and analyzed for total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a and phytoplankton. Other physicochemical parameters were determined \emph{in situ}. The trophic level was calculated with the Carlson Formula. Phytoplankton data were analyzed to determine diversity indices using the Shannon Weiner and Margalef formula.{$<$}br /{$>$} \textbf{Results:} The total nitrogen: total phosphorus ratio of the two lakes was interpreted that nitrogen could be the limiting factor for primary production. Trophic state index values from total phosphorus, chlorophyll a and Secchi disc transparency of both lakes exceeded the criteria at which lakes are interpreted as eutrophic. The dominance of blue green algae and abundance of green algae in both lakes further suggested they are eutrophic. The Shannon-Weiner and Margalef diversity indices for Eleyele and Asejire Lakes were H= 0.78, d = 8.78 and H= 0.72, d= 8.02, respectively.{$<$}br /{$>$} \textbf{Conclusion:} These values suggested the lakes are in eutrophic condition. Future management activities need to reduce phosphorus load of the two lakes.},

However, little is known about its importance in small tropical lakes and reservoirs. We hypothesized that (a) DON is higher in these systems than dissolved inorganic N (DIN), and that (b) relative contributions of DON and DIN to the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) pool decrease and increase, respectively, with trophic status. To test these hypotheses, we measured DON and DIN in six lakes and two reservoirs at the Atlantic forest-Cerrado savanna transition in Southeast Brazil, in the rainy and the dry season. With one exception in each season, all oligo- and mesotrophic systems had DON:DIN ratios {$>$}1. DON:DIN ratios were negatively correlated with total phosphorus (TP). This pattern was due to high DIN, mainly ammonium, in eutrophic and hypertrophic systems. DON:DIN ratios {$<$}1 occurred at TP higher than 103 and 104 \textmu g L-1 in the rainy and dry season, respectively. We found a general dominance of DON in near-natural lentic systems at the Atlantic forest-Cerrado savanna transition, which was more pronounced than that reported for other regions. Human alterations to the TDN pool may affect biological communities and ecosystem functioning of these systems.},

  abstract = {Trophic state is an important property of the aquatic ecosystems as it reflects the anthropogenic influence on water quality and the ecological functioning of rivers, lakes and reservoirs. Trophic state indexes provide an insight on how nutrient and light availability controls phytoplankton development. We analyzed data on total phosphorus (TP, N=931), chlorophyll a (Chl a, N=848) and Secchi disk depth (SDD, N=204) monitored in 18 tropical/subtropical reservoirs from 1996 to 2009 by the Environmental Protection Agency of S\~ao Paulo State (Brazil) in a bimonthly basis. Through linear regression with paired data on ``TP\texttimes Chl a'' and ``Chl a\texttimes SDD'', we proposed a new trophic state index for tropical/subtropical reservoirs (TSItsr). Based on the annual geometric mean concentrations of TP and Chl a, we also assessed the risk of occurrence of individual episodes (e.g. Chl a{$\geq$}30{$\mu$}g/L or TP{$\geq$}50{$\mu$}g/L) within six categories: ultraoligotrophic (U), oligotrophic (O), mesotrophic (M), eutrophic (E), supereutrophic (S) and hypereutrophic (H). The upper boundaries (as annual geometric means) are ({$\mu$}g/L): 15.9 (U), 23.8 (O), 36.7 (M), 63.7 (E) and 77.6 (S) for TP and 2.0 (U), 3.9 (O), 10.0 (M), 20.2 (E) and 27.1 (S) for Chl a. The lower boundaries for the hypereutrophic state were ({$\mu$}g/L) 77.7 (TP) and 27.2 (Chl a). Comparisons with criteria available in the literature suggested that trophic state limits established for temperate systems are not suitable for tropical/subtropical reservoirs and may overestimate their enrichment condition. Restrictions of the TSItsr are discussed in light of the limiting-nutrient concept, the spatial and temporal water quality variability and the use of Chl a as an indicator of phytoplankton density and biomass. The TSItsr may aid in reservoirs management as a starting point for analyzing data on water quality in the tropics/subtropics since this issue is of paramount importance worldwide.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) commonly co-limit primary productivity in lakes, and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) is predicted to be greatest under high N, high P regimes. Because land use practices can alter N and P biogeochemical cycles in watersheds, it is unclear whether previously documented phytoplankton\textendash nutrient relationships apply where landscapes are highly disturbed. Here, we analyzed a lake water quality database from an agricultural region to explore relationships among Chl-a, total N (TN), and total P (TP) under extreme nutrient concentrations. Chl-a was weakly related to TN when TP was {$\leq$}100 {$\mu$}g L-1 but displayed a stronger response to TN at higher TP. When TP exceeded 100 {$\mu$}g L-1, Chl-a increased with increasing TN until reaching a TN threshold of 3 mg L-1 and decreased thereafter, resulting in a high nutrient, low Chl-a region that did not coincide with shifts in nutrient limitation, light availability, cellular Chl-a content, phytoplankton composition, or zooplankton grazing pressure. Beyond the threshold, nitrate comprised most of TN and occurred with reduced dissolved organic matter (DOM). These observations suggest that photolysis of nitrate may produce reactive oxygen species that damage DOM and phytoplankton. Reduction in N loading at high P could therefore increase Chl-a and decrease water clarity, resulting in an apparent worsening of water quality. Our data suggest that monitoring Chl-a or Secchi depth may fail to indicate water quality degradation by extreme nutrient concentrations. These findings highlight how extreme nutrient regimes in lakes can produce novel relationships between phytoplankton and nutrients.},

  abstract = {1. This synthesis examines 35 long-term (5\textendash 35 years, mean: 16 years) lake re-oligotrophication studies. It covers lakes ranging from shallow (mean depth {$<$}5 m and/or polymictic) to deep (mean depth up to 177 m), oligotrophic to hypertrophic (summer mean total phosphorus concentration from 7.5 to 3500 {$\mu$}g L-1 before loading reduction), subtropical to temperate (latitude: 28\textendash 65\textdegree ), and lowland to upland (altitude: 0\textendash 481 m). Shallow north-temperate lakes were most abundant. 2. Reduction of external total phosphorus (TP) loading resulted in lower in-lake TP concentration, lower chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration and higher Secchi depth in most lakes. Internal loading delayed the recovery, but in most lakes a new equilibrium for TP was reached after 10\textendash 15 years, which was only marginally influenced by the hydraulic retention time of the lakes. With decreasing TP concentration, the concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) also declined substantially. 3. Decreases (if any) in total nitrogen (TN) loading were lower than for TP in most lakes. As a result, the TN : TP ratio in lake water increased in 80\% of the lakes. In lakes where the TN loading was reduced, the annual mean in-lake TN concentration responded rapidly. Concentrations largely followed predictions derived from an empirical model developed earlier for Danish lakes, which includes external TN loading, hydraulic retention time and mean depth as explanatory variables. 4. Phytoplankton clearly responded to reduced nutrient loading, mainly reflecting declining TP concentrations. Declines in phytoplankton biomass were accompanied by shifts in community structure. In deep lakes, chrysophytes and dinophytes assumed greater importance at the expense of cyanobacteria. Diatoms, cryptophytes and chrysophytes became more dominant in shallow lakes, while no significant change was seen for cyanobacteria. 5. The observed declines in phytoplankton biomass and chl a may have been further augmented by enhanced zooplankton grazing, as indicated by increases in the zooplankton : phytoplankton biomass ratio and declines in the chl a : TP ratio at a summer mean TP concentration of {$<$}100\textendash 150 {$\mu$}g L-1. This effect was strongest in shallow lakes. This implies potentially higher rates of zooplankton grazing and may be ascribed to the observed large changes in fish community structure and biomass with decreasing TP contribution. In 82\% of the lakes for which data on fish are available, fish biomass declined with TP. The percentage of piscivores increased in 80\% of those lakes and often a shift occurred towards dominance by fish species characteristic of less eutrophic waters. 6. Data on macrophytes were available only for a small subsample of lakes. In several of those lakes, abundance, coverage, plant volume inhabited or depth distribution of submerged macrophytes increased during oligotrophication, but in others no changes were observed despite greater water clarity. 7. Recovery of lakes after nutrient loading reduction may be confounded by concomitant environmental changes such as global warming. However, effects of global change are likely to run counter to reductions in nutrient loading rather than reinforcing re-oligotrophication.},

  abstract = {In order to test hypotheses about changes in the environment induced by man, including climatic change, ecologists are sampling portions of the environment repeatedly across time. This paper describes a method for testing a space\textendash time interaction in repeated ecological survey data, when there is no replication at the level of individual sampling units (sites). This methodological development is important for the analysis of long-term monitoring data, including systems under anthropogenic influence. In these systems, an interaction may indicate that the spatial structure of community composition has changed in the course of time or that the temporal evolution is not the same at all sites. This paper describes ANOVA models corresponding to the steps leading to a solution to the problem, which is based on the representation of space and time by principal coordinates of neighbor matrices (PCNM eigenfunctions) in the ANOVA. Numerical simulations showed that ANOVA Model 5 was the model of choice for the analysis of the space\textendash time interaction because it always had correct rates of Type I error, and its power was always equal to or higher than those of other possible models of analysis. If the hypothesis of absence of interaction is not rejected, one cannot conclude that a change has occurred in the spatial structure of the response data across time; one should follow the ordinary rules of two-way ANOVA if testing the significance of the main factors is of interest. If the hypothesis of absence of interaction is rejected, one should model the spatial structure of each time period in a separate way. One can also conduct a single test involving a separate model of the spatial structure for each time period. This paper presents two applications to real ecological data.},

Temporal beta diversity is measured by the variance of the multivariate community composition time series and that variance can be partitioned using appropriate statistical methods. Some of these methods are classical, such as simple or canonical ordination, whereas others are recent, including the methods of temporal eigenfunction analysis developed for multiscale exploration (i.e. addressing several scales of variation) of univariate or multivariate response data, reviewed, to our knowledge for the first time in this review. These methods are illustrated with ecological data from 13 years of benthic surveys in Chesapeake Bay, USA. The following methods are applied to the Chesapeake data: distance-based Moran's eigenvector maps, asymmetric eigenvector maps, scalogram, variation partitioning, multivariate correlogram, multivariate regression tree, and two-way MANOVA to study temporal and space\textendash time variability. Local (temporal) contributions to beta diversity (LCBD indices) are computed and analysed graphically and by regression against environmental variables, and the role of species in determining the LCBD values is analysed by correlation analysis. A tutorial detailing the analyses in the R language is provided in an appendix.},

  abstract = {1 Two pH electrodes and a thermistor were used to record conditions in the surface of Esthwaite Water every 15 min over a 12-month period. Combined with approximately weekly measurements of alkalinity they allowed inorganic carbon speciation to be calculated. 2 Large changes in pH from 7.1 to nearly 10.3, and hence in concentrations of inorganic carbon species, were measured over a year. Carbon speciation and pH varied on a diel, episodic and seasonal basis. Diel variation of up to pH 1.8 was recorded, although typical daily variation was between 0.03 and 1.06 (5 and 95 percentiles). Daily change in concentration of inorganic carbon varied between 4 and 63 mmol m-3 (5 and 95 percentiles). 3 During lake stratification, episodes of high pH, typically of 1\textendash 2 weeks' duration were interspersed with episodes of lower pH. These changes appeared to relate to the weather: e.g. low wind velocity, high pressure, low rainfall and high sunshine hours correlated with periods of high pH. 4 Seasonal progression of carbon depletion generally followed stratification and the development of high phytoplankton biomass. When the lake was isothermal, the phytoplankton biomass caused relatively small amounts of carbon depletion. 5 During autumn, winter and spring, the lake had concentrations of CO2* (free CO2) up to 0.12 mol m-3 which is nearly seven times the calculated atmospheric equilibrium concentration so the lake will accordingly be losing carbon to the atmosphere. In contrast, during periods of elevated pH the concentration of CO2* was reduced close to zero and the lake will take up atmospheric CO2. The rates of transfer between water and the atmosphere were estimated using a chemical equilibrium model with three boundary layer thicknesses. The calculations show that over a year the lake loses CO2 to the atmosphere with the current mean atmospheric level of 360 {$\mu$}mol mol-1, at between 0.28 and 2.80 mol m-2 yr-1. During elevated pH, rates of CO2-influx increased up to nearly tenfold as a result of chemical-enhancement by parallel flux of HCO-3. Input of CO2* to the lake from the catchment is suggested to be the main source of the carbon lost to the atmosphere. 6 The turnover time for CO2 between the air and water was calculated to be 1 year for the gross influx and 3.3 years for the net flux. These values are less than the average water residence time of 0.25 years, which indicates that over a year inflow from streams is a more important source of inorganic carbon than the atmosphere. 7 Influx of CO2 from the atmosphere was calculated to be roughly equivalent to between 1 and 4\% of the rates of production in the water during mid-summer indicating that this source of inorganic carbon is not a major one in this lake. 8 Influx of CO2 from the hypolimnion was estimated on one occasion to be 6.9 10-9 mol m-2 s-1 using transfer values based on mass eddy-diffusion. These rates are equivalent to 23\% of the rate of influx of CO2 from the atmosphere on this occasion which suggests that the hypolimnion is probably a small source of inorganic carbon to the epilimnion. The exception appears to be during windy episodes when pH is depressed. Calculations based on depth-profiles of CO2* and HCO-3 suggest that the measured changes in pH can be accounted for by entrainment of hypolimnetic water into the epilimnion. 9 The solubility product for calcite was exceeded by up to about sixfold which, although insufficient to allow homogeneous precipitation, may have allowed heterogeneous precipitation around algal particles.},

  abstract = {1. We conducted bioassays of nutrient limitation to understand how macronutrients and the position of streams relative to lakes control nitrogen (N2) fixation and periphytic biomass in three oligotrophic Rocky Mountain catchments. We measured periphytic chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and nitrogen-fixation responses to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) additions using nutrient-diffusing substrata at 19 stream study sites, located above and below lakes within the study catchments. 2. We found that periphytic chl-a was significantly co-limited by N and P at 13 of the 19 sites, with sole limitation by P observed at another four sites, and no nutrient response at the final two sites. On average, the addition of N, P and N + P stimulated chl-a 35\%, 114\% and 700\% above control values respectively. The addition of P alone stimulated nitrogen fixation by 2500\% at five of the 19 sites. The addition of N, either with or without simultaneous P addition, suppressed nitrogen fixation by 73\% at nine of the 19 sites. 3. Lake outlet streams were warmer and had higher dissolved organic carbon concentrations than inlet streams and those further upstream, but position relative to lakes did not affect chl-a and nitrogen fixation in the absence of nutrient additions. Chl-a response to nutrient additions did not change along the length of the study streams, but nitrogen fixation was suppressed more strongly by N, and stimulated more strongly by P, at lower altitude sites. The responses of chl-a and nitrogen fixation to nutrients were not affected by location relative to lakes. Some variation in responses to nutrients could be explained by nitrate and/or total N concentration. 4. Periphytic chl-a and nitrogen fixation were affected by nutrient supply, but responses to nutrients were independent of stream position in the landscape relative to lakes. Understanding interactions between nutrient supply, nitrogen fixation and chl-a may help predict periphytic responses to future perturbations of oligotrophic streams, such as the deposition of atmospheric N.},

  abstract = {Lakes and reservoirs around the world are facing a substantial water quality degradation problem that poses significant environmental, social, and economic impacts. Reservoir productivity is influenced primarily by the climatic, morphometric, and hydro-edaphic features. High nutrient loadings in the reservoir from agriculture runoff often provide ideal conditions for algal blooms, leading to eutrophication. Reservoir and lake management to prevent or reduce eutrophication, therefore, has become the need of the hour. The traditional approach of trophic state monitoring by rigorous field surveys and eutrophication modeling has been revised in the present study by developing a new trophic state index (TSI)-based model for tropical shallow freshwater reservoirs. The new model has been constructed based on Carlson's Limnology and Oceanography, 22, 361-369, (1977) guidelines by establishing an empirical relationship between trophic parameters including total phosphorus (TP), Secchi disk depth (SDD), and chlorophyll (Chl-a). After comparing the new model with various earlier models for its applicability and validation with actual field conditions, it was found to be most precise over previous TSI models. Temporal and spatial fluctuations in the water quality of the Tiru reservoir were primarily attributed to the changing climatic conditions during the study period. Seasonal monsoon with less frequency, heavy nutrient loading from agriculture runoff, and increased turbidity due to a high level of sediment inflow during monsoon raised the TSI (SDD) values of the Tiru reservoir to place it in the hyper-eutrophic class. Average TSI values during winter for SDD, Chl-a, and TP were indicative of the meso-eutrophic to eutrophic state. Saturation of nutrients due to low water level during summer season caused the poly-eutrophic condition for TSI (SDD)- and TSI (TP)-based estimates and eutrophic condition as per TSI (Chl-a) estimates. However, seasonal deviations of the TSI values based on the relationship between TSI (Chl-a) and TSI (SD) indicated a predominance of smaller particles (non-algal turbidity) during all seasons. Even though TP present in the Tiru reservoir is controlling the algal production, it is also affected by low-light conditions due to non-algal turbidity. The recommendation from this study is that the TSI method for estimating the health of the water bodies is the efficient, cost-effective, and time-saving approach. The model developed during the study would help managers and policy makers to take necessary steps to reduce eutrophication levels in the reservoir and would be helpful for researchers in developing new concepts and protocols, mainly focusing on shallow freshwater reservoirs.},

  abstract = {In the Earth's geological record massive marine ecological change has been attributed to the occurrence of widespread anoxia in the ocean [Jahren, 2002; White, 2002; Wignall and Twitchett, 1996]. Climate change projection till the end of this century predict a 4 to 7\% decline in the dissolve oxygen in the ocean [Bopp et al., 2002; Matear et al., 2000; Plattner et al., 2001; Sarmiento et al., 1998] suggesting the potential for global warming to eventually drive the deep ocean anoxic. To examine the multicentury impact of protracted global warming on oceanic concentrations of dissolved oxygen, we use a climate system model and a low-order oceanic biogeochemical model. The models are integrated for an atmospheric equivalent CO2 concentration, which is specified to triple according to a standard scenario from the late nineteenth to the late twenty-first century, and then is subsequently held constant at that elevated level for an additional 6 centuries. For the present day, the model successfully reproduced the large-scale features of the dissolved oxygen field in the ocean. In the global warming simulation, the physical model displays marked changes in high-latitude oceanic stratification and overturning, including near-cessation of deep water renewal for depths greater than about 1.5 km during the period of elevated stable CO2 concentration. Our model predicts a decline in oxygen concentration through most of the subsurface ocean. Concentration changes in the thermocline waters result mainly from solubility changes in the upstream source waters, while changes in the deep waters result mainly from lack of ventilation and ongoing consumption of oxygen by remineralization of sinking particulate organic matter. Changes in the upper 2 km of the ocean generally show signs of equilibration by the end of the integration, but at greater depths, there occurs a slow but steady decline through to the end of the integration. By the end of the integration, we simulate a doubling of the volume of hypoxic water (less than 10 {$\mu$}mol/kg) in the thermocline of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. During the integration deep ocean oxygen concentrations generally decline by between 20 and 40\%, but, significantly, no extensive deep ocean anoxia develops during the period of integration, nor does it appear that it would likely do so for at least a further 4000 years of integration. Subsurface oxygen decline is moderated by an overall reduction in export production of particulate organic matter, which reduces oxygen consumption in the ocean interior due to the remineralization of this material.},

  abstract = {Globally, conversion of pristine areas to anthropogenic landscapes is one of the main causes of ecosystem service losses. Land uses associated with urbanization and farming can be major sources of pollution to freshwaters promoting artificial inputs of several elements, leading to impaired water quality. However, how the effects of land use on freshwater quality are contingent on properties of the local landscape and climate is still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of landscape properties (morphometric measurements of lakes and their catchments), precipitation patterns, and land use properties (extent and proximity of the land use to freshwaters) on water quality of 98 natural lakes and reservoirs in northeast Brazil. Water quality impairment (WQI) was expressed as a composite variable incorporating parameters correlated with eutrophication including nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and Chlorophyll-a concentration. Regression tree analysis showed that WQI is mainly related to highly impacted ``buffer areas''. However, the effects of land use in these adjacent lands were contingent on precipitation variability for 13\% of waterbodies and on surface area of the buffer in relation to the volume of waterbody (BA:Vol) for 87\% of waterbodies. Overall, effects on WQI originating from the land use in the adjacent portion of the lake were amplified by high precipitation variability for ecosystems with highly impacted buffer areas and by high BA:Vol for ecosystems with less impacted buffer areas, indicating that ecosystems subjected to intense episodic rainfall events (e.g. storms) and higher buffer areas relative to aquatic ecosystem size (i.e. small waterbodies) are more susceptible to impacts of land use. Land use at the catchment scale was important for the largest ecosystems. Thus, our findings point toward the need for considering a holistic approach to managing water quality, which includes watershed management within the context of climate change.},

In this work, the main aim was to evaluate the presence of multiple genes from each of the clusters responsible for biosynthesis of cyanotoxins (cylindrospermopsin, microcystin and saxitoxin) in total DNA obtained from sixteen environmental water samples by PCR. Microcystin gene mcyE was amplified in all analyzed samples. Among the cylindrospermopsin genes analyzed, only the cyrC gene was amplified from DNA obtained from three of sixteen samples. Of the three different saxitoxin genes analyzed, sxtB and sxtI were present in four and three of the sixteen samples studied, respectively, and sxtA did not show any positive result. Based on our results, we suggest caution when using only one gene from the full clusters responsible for biosynthesis of cyanotoxins, given that it may not be sufficient to confirm or exclude the toxigenic potential of a sample.},

Para isso, foram considerados tr\^es cen\'arios de opera\c{c}\~ao para o Reservat\'orio: no primeiro, adotou-se diferentes valores de transfer\^encia de \'agua para o Reservat\'orio, al\'em de demanda consuntiva fixa; no segundo, a transfer\^encia de \'aguas foi suprimida e considerou-se diferentes demandas consuntivas; no terceiro, empregou-se o re\'uso pot\'avel indireto da \'agua como aux\'ilio para recarga do Reservat\'orio, e considerou-se diferentes demandas consuntivas. Os indicadores de desempenho estat\'isticos confiabilidade, resili\^encia e vulnerabilidade e o \'Indice de Sustentabilidade H\'idrica foram calculados. Os resultados obtidos para o Cen\'ario 1, pelo cruzamento entre os fatores crit\'erios de desempenho versus bombeamento do reservat\'orio, indicaram que a confiabilidade, a resili\^encia e o \'Indice de Sustentabilidade H\'idrica aumentaram, ao passo que a vulnerabilidade do sistema diminuiu significativamente. No Cen\'ario 2, observou-se que o aumento da demanda h\'idrica implica em redu\c{c}\~oes significativas da confiabilidade, da resili\^encia e da sustentabilidade h\'idrica e um aumento da vulnerabilidade do sistema. Por \'ultimo, o Cen\'ario 3 demonstrou que a recarga do Reservat\'orio por meio da \'agua de re\'uso proporciona melhorias no seu desempenho se comparado ao Cen\'ario 2, e beneficia a redu\c{c}\~ao dos impactos ambientais provindos do lan\c{c}amento dos esgotos na Billings.

  abstract = {To ensure a safe drinking water supply, it is necessary to protect water quality. To classify the suitability of the Or\'os Reservoir (Northeast of Brazil) water for human consumption, a Water Quality Index (WQI) was enhanced and refined through a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Samples were collected bi-monthly at seven points (P1 \textendash{} P7) from July 2009 to July 2011. Samples were analysed for 29 physico-chemical attributes and 4 macroinvertebrate metrics associated with the macrophytes Pistia stratiotes and Eichhornia crassipes. PCA allowed us to reduce the number of attributes from 33 to 12, and 85.32~\% of the variance was explained in five dimensions (C1 \textendash{} C5). Components C1 and C3 were related to water-soluble salts and reflect the weathering process, while C2 was related to surface runoff. C4 was associated with macroinvertebrate diversity, represented by ten pollution-resistant families. C5 was related to the nutrient phosphorus, an indicator of the degree of eutrophication. The mean values for the WQIs ranged from 49 to 65 (rated as fair), indicating that water can be used for human consumption after treatment. The lowest values for the WQI were recorded at the entry points to the reservoir (P3, P1, P5, and P4), while the best WQIs were recorded at the exit points (P6 and P7), highlighting the reservoir's purification ability. The proposed WQI adequately expressed water quality, and can be used for monitoring surface water quality.},

  abstract = {Hypoxia, triggered in large part by eutrophication, exerts widespread and expanding stress on coastal ecosystems. Hypoxia is often specifically defined as water having dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations {$<$} 2 mg L-1. However, DO concentration alone is insufficient to categorize hypoxic stress or predict impacts of hypoxia on zooplankton and fish. Hypoxic stress depends on the oxygen supply relative to metabolic demand. Water temperature controls both oxygen solubility and the metabolic demand of aquatic ectotherms. Accordingly, to assess impacts of hypoxia requires consideration of effects of temperature on both oxygen availability and animal metabolism. Temperature differences across ecosystems or across seasons or years within an ecosystem can dramatically impact the severity of hypoxia even at similar DO concentrations. Living under sub-optimum DO can reduce temperature-dependent metabolic efficiencies, prey capture efficiency, growth and reproductive potential, thus impacting production and individual zooplankton and fish fitness. Avoidance of hypoxic bottom water can reduce or eliminate low-temperature thermal refuges for organisms and increase energy demands and respiration rates, and potentially reduce overall fitness if alternative habitats are sub-optimal. Moreover, differential habitat shifts among species can shift predator-prey abundance ratios or interactions and thus modify food webs. For example, more tolerant zooplankton prey may use hypoxic waters as a refuge from fish predation. In contrast, zooplankton avoidance of hypoxic bottom waters can result in prey aggregations at oxyclines sought out by fish predators. Hypoxic conditions that affect spatial ecology can drive taxonomic and size shifts in the zooplankton community, affecting foraging, consumption and growth of fish. Advances in understanding the ecological effects of low DO waters on pelagic zooplankton and fish and comparisons among ecosystems will require development of generic models that estimate the oxygen demand of organisms in relation to oxygen supply which depends on both DO and temperature. We provide preliminary analysis of a metric (Oxygen Stress Level) which integrates oxygen demand in relation to oxygen availability for a coastal copepod and compare the prediction of oxygen stress to actual copepod distributions in areas with hypoxic bottom waters.},

  abstract = {Freshwater has a significant role in determining the ecological environment, public health and socio-economic development. This study analyzed the spatio-temporal variation in surface water quality of the tropical reservoir Mettur, India, to determine whether its water is suitable for human consumption and aquatic ecosystem. Thus, 21 water quality parameters were monitored seasonally (pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon) at nine sampling sites covering riverine, transitional and lacustrine zones of the reservoir during 2018. The study revealed spatial variation, which was due to input from industrial and domestic wastewater in the lacustrine zone of the reservoir. However, temporal variability often exceeded spatial variability. The factor analysis indicates that basin geology, anthropogenic stress and agricultural applications simultaneously act vital roles in deciding the reservoir water quality. Based on similarity of water quality parameters, cluster analysis grouped all the nine sampling sites into three clusters of high, moderate and less polluted sites. Correlation analysis also indicated that multiple sources influence the reservoir water quality during all the seasons. Based on BIS and WHO values, the calculated water quality index (134\textendash 158) indicates that water of the reservoir is not fit for human consumption, while the trophic state of this reservoir is moderately-eutrophic to eutrophic. However, with precaution, this aquatic body seems to be suitable for aquatic life and fish growth. The overall water quality deterioration of this reservoir indicates a strong need for development of a regular monitoring system for implementation of an effective management system to safeguard human and environmental health.},

This is a serious problem that is widely expected to intensify as climate change strengthens the hydrological cycle. To address the current lack of adequate analysis, Sinha et al. present estimates of riverine nitrogen loading for the continental United States, based on projections of precipitation derived from climate models (see the Perspective by Seitzinger and Phillips). Anticipated changes in precipitation patterns are forecast to cause large and robust increases in nitrogen fluxes by the end of the century.Science, this issue p. 405; see also p. 350Eutrophication, or excessive nutrient enrichment, threatens water resources across the globe. We show that climate change\textendash induced precipitation changes alone will substantially increase (19 {$\pm$} 14\%) riverine total nitrogen loading within the continental United States by the end of the century for the ``business-as-usual'' scenario. The impacts, driven by projected increases in both total and extreme precipitation, will be especially strong for the Northeast and the corn belt of the United States. Offsetting this increase would require a 33 {$\pm$} 24\% reduction in nitrogen inputs, representing a massive management challenge. Globally, changes in precipitation are especially likely to also exacerbate eutrophication in India, China, and Southeast Asia. It is therefore imperative that water quality management strategies account for the impact of projected future changes in precipitation on nitrogen loading.},

Retention time and high nutrient availability in the water increases the eutrophic level. Eutrophication is directly correlated to primary productivity by phytoplankton. These organisms have an important role in the environment. However, high concentrations of determined species can lead to public health problems. Species of cyanobacteria produce toxins that in determined concentrations can cause serious diseases in the liver and nervous system, which could lead to death. Phytoplankton has photoactive pigments that can be used to identify these toxins.  Thus, remote sensing data is a viable alternative for mapping these pigments, and consequently, the trophic. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is present in all phytoplankton species. Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate the performance of images of the sensor Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard the Landsat-8 satellite in determining Chl-a concentrations and estimating the trophic level in a tropical reservoir. Empirical models were fitted using data from two field surveys conducted in May and October 2014 (Austral Autumn and Austral Spring, respectively). Models were applied in a temporal series of OLI images from May 2013 to October 2014. The estimated Chl-a concentration was used to classify the trophic level from a trophic state index that adopted the concentration of this pigment-like parameter. The models of Chl-a concentration showed reasonable results, but their performance was likely impaired by the atmospheric correction. Consequently, the trophic level classification also did not obtain better results.},

Water samples were taken along a vertical profile during the winter (August 2009) and summer (February 2010) and in the surface sediments (2 cm) during the winter. Physical and chemical characteristics of water and sediments were evaluated. Lamparelli's Trophic State Index (TSI) was calculated; RESULTS: limnological variability was mostly affected by the season. The spatial heterogeneity of the Complex was more pronounced during winter, with greater differences among its compartments. Nitrogen was higher in the winter, whereas in the summer there was a substantial phosphorus increase along with a nitrogen decrease. The most degraded compartments, associated with the highest nutrient levels, were CB and TQ. In contrast, the upstream region of the RP branch was considered a reference site (the least impacted) for the Complex; CONCLUSION: The Billings Complex ranged from mesotrophic (RP) or eutrophic (RG) to super-eutrophic (CC, TQ). High TSI variation also occurred within compartments and/or depending on the season, mainly associated with the human management of the Complex. The surface sediments underlined the differences observed between the extremes in the Billings Complex water quality, as well as providing additional information on other impacts that was not observed from the water analysis. A slight improvement in the water quality of the Central body and the Taquacetuba branch has been observed since 2009, possibly associated with the Pinheiros River flotation project.},
